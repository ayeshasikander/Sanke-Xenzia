## Project Structure 📁

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the game board and necessary elements.
- `snake.js`: Module containing logic for the snake, including movement, collision detection, and intersection.
- `grid.js`: Module providing utility functions for managing the game grid.
- `food.js`: Module handling the generation and rendering of food items.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the game board and elements.
- `script.js`: Main script file orchestrating the game loop and user interactions.

## Features 🚀

1. **Snake Movement**: The snake moves automatically in the specified direction.
2. **Food Generation**: Random food items appear on the grid for the snake to consume.
3. **Scoring**: Keep track of your score as you eat more food. The score increases by 2 for each food item consumed.
4. **Game Pause**: Press the spacebar to pause and resume the game. An alert notifies the player about the game state.
5. **Game Over**: The game ends if the snake collides with the game boundaries or itself. An alert is displayed, and the game can be restarted.

## Getting Started 🎮
